An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

This template is based on the [ADR template by Michael Nygard](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md) and the [ADR template MADR](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_madr.md).
