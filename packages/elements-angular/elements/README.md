This is the integration layer package for integrating the inovex elements into Angular projects.

## Contributing

Please refer to the top level [README](../../../README.md) to see the available script commands.

### Adding or Removing Components

Everytime a new component ist added or removed from the `@inovex.de/elements` package you must ensure that the following files are written after running the `build` command:

- `src/directives/proxies-list.ts`
- `src/directives/proxies.ts`

These files are updated automatically. 
This ensures that the component is available for the consumer in the Angular world. 
If the component needs a custom value accessor to support the `ngModel` directive, please update the following files also:

- `src/public-api` (modify)
- `src/ino-elements.module.ts` (modify)
- `src/directives/control-value-accesors/ino-COMPONENT-NAME-value-accessor.directive.ts` (create)

### Schematics
For a detailed explanation of schematics in Angular, see [this guide](https://angular.io/guide/schematics).

At this moment, `ng-add` is the only schematic this library provides.
All the related files are located under `/schematics`.

In order to test the functionality of the schematics, we make use of our linking tool `yalc`:
1. Add a new schematic or make changes to the existing one
2. Run `publish:yalc` at the root of this project and select angular
3. In your consuming project, install [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) and run `yalc link @inovex.de/elements-angular`
4. Run `ng add @inovex.de/elements-angular`

### Updating the Angular Integration Layer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0 as an Angular library project. 
So you can update this project as you would do any other Angular library project.
