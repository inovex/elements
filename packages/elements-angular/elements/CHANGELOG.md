## [8.0.0](https://github.com/BenPag/elements/compare/v7.1.0...v8.0.0) (2022-10-05)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **elements|ino-switch:** As part of the design update, we've decided to remove the `color-scheme` property in all input elements. Read above for more information.
* **elements|ino-form-row:** Since our input component provides a label on its own, this component is obsolete. That's why we've decided to remove it.
* **elements|ino-range:** As part of the design update, we've decided to remove the `color-scheme` property in all input elements. Read above for more information.
* **elements|ino-sidebar:** Since the component is just a container with a simple slide animation and does not provide any other functionality or styling, we decided to remove it.

### Features

* **elements-angular:** support disable state handling in ControlValueAccessors ([#664](https://github.com/BenPag/elements/issues/664)) ([18a02b3](https://github.com/BenPag/elements/commit/18a02b3d40c4a9654e911745ec89f738e7297a37))

### [7.1.1](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v7.1.0...v7.1.1) (2022-08-19)


### Features

* **elements-angular:** support disable state handling in ControlValueAccessors ([#664](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/664)) ([18a02b3](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/18a02b3d40c4a9654e911745ec89f738e7297a37))


## [7.0.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v6.2.0...v7.0.0) (2022-05-23)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **elements|ino-input:** Remove the `size` property of the `<ino-input>` as it has no effect. Use `width` and `height` to change the dimensions of the element.
* **elements|ino-button:** We've updated the design of the `<ino-button>`. In order to have a consistent look and feel across all of our components, we've decided to get rid of the `colorScheme` property and most of our CSS-Variables. If you need to customize the button, you can do that just like any other HTML Element as we removed the Shadow-DOM of the component. Furthermore, we removed/reworked some old props on our way. The `fill` property has been renamed to `variant` and features the options `filled` (previously known as `solid), `outlined`, and `text` (replacement of `inverse`). The property `edgeMirrored` has been removed as its use case was very specific.

### Features

* **elements|ino-popover:** add follow cursor option ([#577](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/577)) ([dc76d3c](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/dc76d3c942f00deed72af15e3a2619f65d420cae))


* **elements|ino-button:** update styling ([#571](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/571)) ([0867d86](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/0867d86f095e3f13e91aef2362f25c97cdb8453a))

* **elements|ino-input:** remove size property ([#557](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/557)) ([d69af55](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/d69af5529134ec3d0b697635cae224e30b01cbca))

## [6.2.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v6.1.0...v6.2.0) (2022-04-22)


### Features

* **elements|ino-popover:** add option to attach popover to body ([#575](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/575)) ([6b18745](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/6b18745b866ab498993ce5057488790703c6c8c0))

## [6.1.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v6.0.0...v6.1.0) (2022-03-10)


### Features

* **elements|ino-select:** add helper text props ([#553](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/553)) ([b117525](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/b117525dfa6f5158911718fe766e5e2b098fab96))


### Miscellaneous

* **elements:** add stencil linter ([#547](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/547)) ([1c28f62](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/1c28f629efb7544e0cdf998bc6dc58c3a7d42529))

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v5.1.0...v6.0.0) (2022-03-02)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **elements|ino-table:** Due to performance reasons we have removed the components `<ino-table-row>` and `<ino-table-cell>`. The `<ino-table>` has been reworked to work with the native table elements (`<tr>` and `<td>`). Additionally, a new component `<ino-table-header-cell>` was provided to be used instead of the `<th>` element to implement functionalities like filtering and sorting. For extensive examples, check out the respective stories.
* **elements:** * `ino-progress-bar`: Removed `reversed` property as it is no longer supported by our underlying library
* `ino-chip-set`: Has been removed because it was only a wrapper, whose logic does not demand a component of its own.
* `ino-chip`: This component has undergone an extensive rework. We removed the already deprecated `icon` property (use slots instead). The event `removeChip` has been renamed to `chipRemoved` to be consistent with our naming scheme. The event now emits `value` as its detail instead of the element itself (element can still be accessed by `event.target`).
* `ino-switch`: All CSS-Vars have been removed in order to keep a more consistent look across the library and also to reduce the maintenance cost.
* **elements|ino-dialog:** In order to provide better flexibility, we removed all named slots. Now there is only the default slot that can be used to provide your own header and footer beside the content. Furthermore, the `openChange` event has been renamed to `close` which emits whenever the user closes the dialog. Added an option to make non-critical dialogs dismissible by pressing `esc` or clicking outside the dialog.
* **elements|ino-currency-input:** Move currency input functionality of `<ino-input>` to a separate component `<ino-currency-input>` to reduce the complexity of the input component. In the course of this, we removed the properties `decimalPlaces` and `thousandsSeparator` from the `<ino-input>`. The new component supports these functionalities by providing the respective locale.

### Features

* **elements:** add global configuration ([#460](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/460)) ([ffac7fe](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/ffac7fe5b8df8c67cda83cff60ffc441bddf06c7))

* **elements|ino-dialog:** rework the dialog component ([#483](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/483)) ([c69a23e](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/c69a23eb4f0ca70bf89cbf696da947c2d65fae7f))
* **elements|ino-markdown-editor:** add new component ([#471](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/471)) ([8803083](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/88030835d52ed638d0a467fdfa90d2bd57ec631b))
* **elements|ino-table:** rework the component along with all the related elements ([#459](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/459)) ([a3141e3](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/a3141e348b1088832c8a8cdde07922ed4b4a3374))


### Miscellaneous

* **elements:** update mdc packages to v13 ([#349](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/349)) ([77452bf](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/77452bf4f97862c7ee0a576a071c0649d67fc30b))

## [5.1.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0) (2021-11-30)


### Features

* **elements:** add focus and blur methods to input elements ([#306](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/306)) ([c2de9a0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/c2de9a0c50eae893edee7ea4fd9f6cd829cdf869))


### Miscellaneous

* add linux support for `publish:yalc` ([#448](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/448)) ([0a12f8c](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/0a12f8c9979e7dc0f85e0656ef19d27508e5e57c))
* update readmes ([#445](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/445)) ([2784a2c](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/2784a2c51a94369dd2229bbe619e8d04b4422179))

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v4.1.1...v5.0.0) (2021-10-18)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **elements|ino-autocomplete:** - rename event `optionSelected` to `valueChange` for consistency sake
- remove slot `list`, now only takes an `<ino-input>` in the `input` slot and `<ino-option>`s in the default slot
* **elements|ino-snackbar:** remove types `primary` & `warning` and add new types `info` (default) & `success`; remove alignment properties

The snackbar has received a new design, which features the three cases info, success, and error. Also, as part of the new design, we have decided that the snackbar will now be displayed in the top right corner by default. Since we want to get away from offering properties that only make changes to the CSS in the background, we have removed the alignment properties and instead introduced CSS variables that can be used to configure the absolute position of the snackbar. For more information, have a look at its storybook page.
* **elements|ino-snackbar:** rename property `alignment` to `horizontalAlignment` in order to improve clarity

### Features

* **elements|ino-datepicker:** provide error property ([#429](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/429)) ([43f37ef](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/43f37efd0c4dfe9748d7b12101732d8c47cd672d))
* **elements|ino-select:** add property `error` to display error state ([#424](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/424)) ([f3b97c6](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/f3b97c60807599a66a2763e5358c7f2bc48c073d))
* **elements|ino-snackbar:** add new property `verticalAlignment` ([#427](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/427)) ([1c34299](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/1c34299ed97405e3e47800d2ca6c037a6d7f6fd9))
* **elements|ino-snackbar:** rework snackbar ([#431](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/431)) ([76911a3](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/76911a34ce4d5c5588dcacdf612441b5c54e5693))


### Refactoring

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0) (2021-07-05)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **elements-angular:** Angular 12 only works with Webpack 5, so we had to adapt our previous way of importing icons. To keep using our `ino-icon` it is necessary that you add the elements via Angular CLI: `ng add @inovex.de/elements-angular`. This also applies if the Elements are already installed. For more detailed instructions, check out our Angular integration guide.
* **storybook:** We decided to remove the `ino` prefixes of all component properties. Originally, they were a convenience to distinguish between native and custom properties. Nowadays the prefixes just make for unnecessarily longer code.

So to upgrade to the latest version it is necessary to remove these prefixes. As an example: `ino-loading` or `inoLoading` becomes `loading`.
To assist with this, here is a regex that can be used to search and replace these properties: `(?:\s)(ino)`.

### Features

* **elements|ino-img:** add fallback img ([#339](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/339)) ([6caec70](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/6caec708d4f61a64cd34dbebc119c9f70c9cd135))
* **elements|ino-snackbar:** add property to make snackbar stay visible on hover ([#365](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/365)) ([bf6b702](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/bf6b7023cd9fe9caf4761f6eb57b4f2cc63bc577))
* **storybook:** upgrade storybook to v6 ([#316](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/316)) ([dcd7260](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/dcd7260fd105339afbc8fd64c1557e9cc5fd723e))


### Miscellaneous

* **elements-angular:** update angular to work with version 12 ([#386](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/386)) ([c9d123e](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/c9d123ecc19f4ffe1de906645bef6de6310b7c19))
* migrate from tslint to eslint ([#283](https://github.com/inovex/elements/issues/283)) ([19a4bf6](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/19a4bf65fe02649ef4b701f61b329c48b90f3b06))
* publish v3.0.1 ([ca7a24d](https://github.com/inovex/elements/commit/ca7a24d68944c06c78d88f58ec5151966c0210a6))

### [3.0.1](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) (2021-04-22)

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v2.3.0...v3.0.0) (2021-04-13)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **elements|ino-menu:** We have reworked the `ino-menu` so that it is now a composition of the `ino-popover` and `ino-list`. It now acts as a smart component that manages its own state. As a result, fewer properties need to be specified. If more complex functionality is required, one can easily build this using the `ino-popover` and the `ino-list`.

To be specific, the `ino-open`, as well as the `ino-for` property has been removed. The parent node of the `ino-menu` now automatically acts as an anchor element for the menu. Since the state is now managed by the component, the `ino-open` property and the `menuClose` event are obsolete. The menu now opens on anchor click and closes on outside click.

Before:
```jsx
<button id="my-anchor" onClick={() => this.setState({ isMenuOpen: true })}>Open Menu</button>
<InoMenu ino-open={this.state.isMenuOpen} ino-for="my-anchor" onMenuClose={() => this.setState({ isMenuOpen: false })}>
  <InoListItem>...</InoListItem>
</InoMenu>
```
After:
```jsx
<button>
  Open Menu
  <InoMenu>
    <InoListItem>...</InoListItem>
  </InoMenu>
</button>
```

For more information, have a look at the [storybook page of the ino-menu](https://elements.inovex.de/dist/latest/storybook/?path=/story/structure-ino-menu--default-usage).
* **elements|ino-button:** We have removed the property `ino-full-width` of the `ino-button` as this styling should be achieved by simple css.

e.g.:
```css
ino-button {
  width: 100%;
}
```
* **elements|ino-icon:** We have changed our internal icon handling to make working with them more intuitive.
If you are currently using the elements with Vue.js, you need to update your icon import like this:

**From**: `import { ICON_PATHS } from '@inovex.de/elements/dist/inovex-elements/icon-assets/SVG/index.esm.js';`

**To**: `import { ICON_PATHS } from '@inovex.de/elements/dist/inovex-elements/ino-icon/index.esm.js';`
* **elements:** Previously, we used certain properties as flags to indicate that a slot was in use. 
We wrote our own utility to check the contents of the slot at runtime, making these properties obsolete. 
For this reason, we removed the following properties which can safely be removed:
- `inoIconLeading`
- `inoIconTrailing`

These properties occurred in the following components:
- `ino-button`
- `ino-chip`
- `ino-input`

### Features

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) (2020-10-20)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **elements-angular:** In order to use the latest elements-angular package, change the `imports: [..., InoElementsModule]` inside your `app.module.ts` to `imports: [..., InoElementsModule.forRoot()]`.
The reason for this change is, that we upgraded our internally used Angular dependencies to version 10.1.4 which required us to add some startup capabilities inside the `forRoot` function. We updated our integration guide accordingly.

### [1.0.1](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1) (2020-09-22)

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/inovex/elements/compare/v0.21.0...v1.0.0) (2020-09-16)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* We changed the scopes of all our packages from `@inovex` to  `@inovex.de` in order to match our newly created NPM org. Unfortunately, `@inovex` was already taken. To use the inovex-elements beyond version 0.21.0, you have to change the scope in your dependencies from `@inovex/*` to `@inovex.de/*`. This way you will receive our new versions from the public registry of npmjs.
* **elements|ino-button:** The API of the `<ino-button>` has changed. We've replaced the `ino-icon` property.
If you want to use an `ino-icon` inside of a button, use the `ino-icon-leading` or `ino-icon-trailing` property and provide the `<ino-icon>` element as a child of the `<ino-button>` with the slot being either `ino-icon-leading` or `ino-icon-trailing`. See the example below:
    
    ```html
    <!-- Old -->
    <ino-button ino-icon="info">Button with leading icon</ino-button>
    
    <!-- New -->
    <ino-button ino-icon-leading>
      <ino-icon ino-icon="info" slot="ino-icon-leading"></ino-icon>
      Button with leading icon
    </ino-button>
    ```
    
    While this does seem like more work for the consumer, we implemented this change in order to have a consistent way of using the `<ino-icon>` in combination with our other components. These changes also offer much more flexibility in the use of the `<ino-icon>` as you can now utilize the whole API of the `<ino-icon>` component (e.g. using your own icons, providing your custom click handler, ...).
