# Integrate with Angular

> We set up a demo project with Angular CLI to show you how to integrate the components into a newly generated Angular project.
> Scroll down to see the CodeSandbox.These instructions are based on `angular@12.0.0` and [`angular-cli@12.0.0`](https://cli.angular.io/).

## Install dependency `@inovex.de/elements-angular`

We provide an integration layer package for Angular, so you can integrate the elements as an Angular library into your Angular project.
To install it, you have the following options:
<CH.Code>
  ```bash angular-cli
  ng add @inovex.de/elements-angular
  ```
  ```bash npm
  npm install @inovex.de/elements-angular --save
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @inovex.de/elements-angular
  ```
</CH.Code>

The `ino-icons` will be added to your project automatically if you've used the angular-cli.

If you used npm or yarn to install the elements, you need to change `angular.json` manually.
Add the following to your build assets (`projects.<your-project-name>.architect.build.options.assets`) and to your test assets (`projects.<your-project-name>.architect.test.options.assets`).

```json angular.json
// ...
{
  "glob": "**/*",
  "input": "node_modules/@inovex.de/elements/dist/inovex-elements/ino-icon",
  "output": "/ino-icon"
}
// ...
```

## Import the Module `InoElementsModule`

The components we provide in the Angular project are wrapped in Angular directives within an Angular library.
All the `@Input` properties and `@Output` events of our components are included.
This allows your IDE and compiler to infer all the type information from the given interfaces which is compulsive for code completion to work properly.

To use the inovex elements, you need to integrate the `InoElementsModule` into one of your App's modules. To do so, follow these steps:

<CH.Section>
1. [Import the elements module](focus://3)
2. [Add our module to your imports (you can also provide an InoElementsConfig here)](focus://10)
3. [Add the CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA](focus://14)

```typescript app.module.ts
import {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {InoElementsModule} from '@inovex.de/elements-angular';
import {AppComponent} from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    InoElementsModule.forRoot({}),
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
</CH.Section>

If you have more than one module, you should integrate the `InoElementsModule` into each module that is supposed to use the inovex elements.
Alternatively, you can also integrate the components into a shared module.
This way, you only need to import the components once (recommended).

## Use the Components

That's it. You are now ready to use our components.
