# Stylesheet
To make your application look like the inovex-elements from top to bottom,
we have prepared a global stylesheet for you, which brings the basic styles (headings, link, ...) with it.
You can integrate it by using one of our many packages (elements, elements-react, ...) and
giving the body element of your application the class `inovex-elements`.

The following elements now receive the inovex-elements style:
- All headlines (from `<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- [Links](/docs/docs-styleguide-typography--link) (`<a>`)
