# Integrate with React

We provide an integration layer package for React so that you can integrate the elements just like any other dependency
into your React project. The name of the package matches the name of the respective inovex element in PascalCase
(e.g. `InoButton` for `ino-button`).

> We set up a demo project with React to show you how to integrate the components into a newly generated React
> project. Scroll down to see the Stackblitz.
>
> These instructions are based on `react@17.0.2` and [`create-react-app@5.0.0`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
>
> If you want to use TypeScript, please see instructions from the [Adding TypeScript Section on create-react-app.dev](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript).

## 0) Prepare your Project

Before using `@inovex.de/elements`, you should make sure that your current setup works and boots properly.
If this is the case, proceed to the next step.

## 1) Install `@inovex.de/elements-react`

Add the package `@inovex.de/elements-react` to your project using **npm**:

```sh
$ npm install @inovex.de/elements-react --save
```

or **yarn**:

```sh
$ yarn add @inovex.de/elements-react
```

### 2) Use the Components

> Hint: The React integration layer automatically imports the icons. You don't have to import
> them manually.

As the integration is now complete, you can use the components in your project in the same way you would use any other React component.

To help you to get started, we created a [simple todo app](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/inovex/elements-example-react) for you to play around with.

# Create your first Project

**Lets get you up to speed quickly with the usage of the Elements to create a simple login page.**

First we create a new react app for our login page.

```cmd
npx create-react-app <your app name>
cd <your app name>
npm start
```

Once our react app is ready, delete the boilerplate code and restructure the function until our App.js looks something like this.

> Hint: For the Styling and Structure of your App we recommend following along with the provided codesandbox.

```jsx
function App() {
  return <div></div>;
}

export default App;
```

To demonstrate how fast you can create a stylish login form, lets start with our sign in consisting of two input fields for the credentials and one button for the submit.

```jsx
<div className="body">
  <h1>Login to your Account</h1>
  <InoInput label="email" outline></InoInput>
  <InoInput label="password" outline></InoInput>
  <InoButton type="submit">Sign In</InoButton>
</div>
```

## Properties

To configure the components of the inovex-elements we use **properties**.

In this case we give our `<InoInput>` the `outline` property and its corresponding label. More properties of the `<InoInput>` can be found in our **[docs](https://elements.inovex.de/version/v7.1.0/?path=/docs/input-ino-input--playground)**.
`<InoInput label="email" outline={true}>`.

> Hint: We can customize almost all Elements components. Add icons to the `<InoInput>` element by adding a [slot and an icon](https://elements.inovex.de/version/v7.1.0/?path=/docs/input-ino-input--icons) of the `<InoIcon>` component. Play around with each components playground to see all possibilites.

```jsx
<InoInput label="password" outline>
  <InoIcon slot="icon-trailing" icon="password"></InoIcon>
</InoInput>
```

#### CSS Custom Properties

For css customization, we can use **CSS Custom Properties** given by our `<InoInput>` component to style our outlines and labels.

```scss
InoInput {
  --ino-input-line-color: blue;
  --ino-input-label-color: blue;
}
```

Most components have built in styles and themes you can choose from. Lets add a different Notification, everytime our user signs in. 
If the credentials are too short, we use the property `type="error"` of the `<InoSnackbar>` to indicate a failed login attempt. In the case of a succesfull login, we can use  `type="success"`

> Hint: check out our codesandbox for more insights about the functionality.

```jsx
const ValidateLogin = () => {
  if (email.length === 0 || password.length < 8) {
    return (
      <InoSnackbar
        action-text="email and/or password too short"
        timeout={5000}
        type="error"
        stay-visible-on-hover="false"
      >
        Login failed
      </InoSnackbar>
    );
  } else {
    return (
      <InoSnackbar
        action-text="Welcome back!"
        timeout={5000}
        type="success"
        stay-visible-on-hover="false"
      >
        Sucessfully logged in
      </InoSnackbar>
    );
  }
};
```

```jsx
{showSnackbar ? <ValidateLogin /> : null}
```

Change the types accordingly to your wishes. The timeout property is in _ms_ and indicates when the snackbar dissapears. The timeout can be disabled by setting it to a negative value.
More about the properties of the InoSnackbar is documented [here](https://elements.inovex.de/version/v7.1.0/?path=/docs/notification-ino-snackbar--playground).
