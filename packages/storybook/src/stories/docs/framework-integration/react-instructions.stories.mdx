# Integrate with React

We provide an integration layer package for React so that you can integrate the elements just like any other dependency
into your React project. The name of the package matches the name of the respective inovex element in PascalCase
(e.g. `InoButton` for `ino-button`).

> We set up a demo project with React to show you how to integrate the components into a newly generated React
> project. Scroll down to see the Stackblitz.
>
> These instructions are based on `react@17.0.2` and [`create-react-app@5.0.0`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
>
> If you want to use TypeScript, please see instructions from the [Adding TypeScript Section on create-react-app.dev](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript).

## 0) Prepare your Project

Before using `@inovex.de/elements`, you should make sure that your current setup works and boots properly.
If this is the case, proceed to the next step.

## 1) Install `@inovex.de/elements-react`

Add the package `@inovex.de/elements-react` to your project using **npm**:

```sh
$ npm install @inovex.de/elements-react --save
```

or **yarn**:

```sh
$ yarn add @inovex.de/elements-react
```

### 2) Use the Components

> Hint: The React integration layer automatically imports the icons. You don't have to import
> them manually.

As the integration is now complete, you can use the components in your project in the same way you would use any other React component.

To help you to get started, we created a [simple todo app](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/inovex/elements-example-react) for you to play around with.

# Create your first Project

**Lets get you up to speed quickly with the usage of the Elements to create a simple login page.**

First we create a new react app for our login page.

```cmd
npx create-react-app <your app name>
cd <your app name>
npm start
```

Once our react app is ready, delete the boilerplate code and restructure the function until our App.js looks something like this.

> Hint: For the Styling and Structure of your App we recommend following along with the provided codesandbox.

```jsx
function App() {
  return <div></div>;
}

export default App;
```

To demonstrate how fast you can create a stylish login form, lets start with our sign in consisting of two input fields for the credentials and one button for the submit.

```jsx
<div className="body">
  <h1>Login to your Account</h1>
  <InoInput label="email" outline={true}></InoInput>
  <InoInput label="password" outline={true}></InoInput>
  <InoButton type="submit">Sign In</InoButton>
</div>
```

In this case we give both of our `<InoInput>` outlines and their corresponding label. `<InoInput label="email" outline={true}>`.

> Hint: We can customize almost all Elements components, for example by giving the `<InoInput>` an icon or changing the floating label for a helper text. For more customization check out the playground.

```jsx
<InoInput label="password" outline={true}>
    <InoIcon slot="icon-trailing" icon="password"></InoIcon>
</InoInput>
```

To further develop our sign in, lets add social network logins with the `<InoFabSet>` component.
> Hint: `<InoFabSet>` serves as a container for multiple fab buttons. It contains actions related to the main fab button. Upon interacting with the fab button, a FAB-Set can display three to six related actions in the form of a speed dial.

```jsx
<InoFabSet
     open-dial="false"
    dial-direction="right"
    topBottomLocation="top"
    leftRightLocation="left"
>
    <InoFab label="Facebook">
        <InoIcon slot="icon-leading" icon="star"></InoIcon>
    </InoFab>
    <InoFab label="Google">
        <InoIcon slot="icon-leading" icon="favorite"></InoIcon>
    </InoFab>
    <InoFab label="Twitter">
        <InoIcon slot="icon-leading" icon="info"></InoIcon>
    </InoFab>
</InoFabSet>
```
