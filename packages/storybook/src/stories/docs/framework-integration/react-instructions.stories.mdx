# Integrate with React

We provide an integration layer package for React so that you can integrate the inovex Elements just like any other dependency
into your React project. The name of the package matches the name of the respective inovex element in PascalCase
(e.g. `InoButton` for `ino-button`).

> We set up a demo project with React to show you how to integrate the components into a newly generated React
> project. Scroll down to see the Stackblitz.
>
> These instructions are based on `react@17.0.2` and [`create-react-app@5.0.0`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
>
> If you want to use TypeScript, please see instructions from the [Adding TypeScript Section on create-react-app.dev](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript).

## 0) Prepare your Project

Before using `@inovex.de/elements`, you should make sure that your current setup works and boots properly.
If this is the case, proceed to the next step.

## 1) Install `@inovex.de/elements-react`

Add the package `@inovex.de/elements-react` to your project using **npm**:

```sh
$ npm install @inovex.de/elements-react --save
```

or **yarn**:

```sh
$ yarn add @inovex.de/elements-react
```

### 2) Use the Components

> Hint: The React integration layer automatically imports the icons. You don't have to import
> them manually.

As the integration is now complete, you can use the components in your project in the same way you would use any other React component.

To help you to get started, we created a [simple todo app](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/inovex/elements-example-react) for you to play around with.

### 3) Create your first Component
