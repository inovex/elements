# Storybook
Storybook demonstrates the usage and documentation of our components. The storybook itself is a separate package `packages/storybook` having the actual stories in `src/stories`.

Every time we create a new component, we create a new folder `src/stories/<compontent-name>` having at least the following files:
1. `<compontent-name>.stories.ts` containing the stories.
2. `<compontent-name>.stories.mdx` integrating the documentation (component README.md).
2. `<compontent-name>.scss` containing the styling.


## Stories
Each component has ...

- ... a first story named **Playground** having a customizable instance before any other usage examples (see below).
- ... some more specific stories showing full capacities of the component.

### Playground Story
The Playground Story allows the user to see (and interact with) all attributes, properties, methods, events and slots of a component.
This allows users to explore all possible variants of an element. Playground, in this case, means that users can pass any possible value to an element.

When providing Controls for a component:

- Make sure that you use the arg of the extracted properties / attributes from elements json documentation.
- Provide an `arg` for each available attribute / property.


### Additional stories
Having a Playground story as baseline, each component can have several additional stories showing the full capacities of a component. In order to add further description to these stories, we
add doc strings and use the [Story Description Loader Plugin](https://github.com/izhan/storybook-description-loader).

** Example:**
```ts
/**
  * A Fullwidth dialog is a distinct variant which has 100% width an is attached to the bottom of the page. It scrolls up and defines a small
  * margin at top for the background scrim and escape for dialog close.
  * It's not recommenended to use this option with `--ino-dialog-width` and `--ino-dialog-height`.
  */
export const FullWidth = args => html`<ino-dialog ...></ino-dialog>`;
```
