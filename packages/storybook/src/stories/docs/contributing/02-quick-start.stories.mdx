# Quick Start - Clone and try the Project

If you know what is going on or just want to see see how the project runs on your local machine, checkout the repo, and start your local copy of it.

Make sure you have made all the preparations to be ready to start. You can find a [List of Prerequisites](https://github.com/inovex/elements#prerequisites) in our repo.

1. Open a terminal of your choice and switch into a folder where you want to copy the project code in.
2. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/inovex/elements.git`.
3. Switch into the project root folder with `cd elements`.
4. Get all the dependencies with `yarn install`.
5. Storybook will open in your browser with `yarn start`.
6. You have successfully started the project ðŸŽ‰

Now open the button component in the IDE of your choice. This is the file `packages/elements/src/components/ino-button/ino-button.tsx`. Edit something within the `render` method on the lower part of the file. Save your changes and switch back to your browser. Select the `ino-button` entry from within the side panel. You will see your changes.

Happy coding!
