# Team Organization

We coordinate stories, tasks and bugs in the [inovex Elements Github project](https://github.com/inovex/elements/projects/1).

## Plannings

We organize the workload from time to time and do not have a regular schedule. All team members will be notified when we have a new appointment. Invitations will be sent via Slack or email.

## Weeklies

We meet remotely once a week, every Monday, 3 PM in a Google Meets call. Every team member will be invited via Slack or email.
