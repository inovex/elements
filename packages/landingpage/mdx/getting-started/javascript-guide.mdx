# Integrate with Javascript
<MenuSection title='About the Elements'>

The components provided in this package work out-of-the box and are shipped with a preloader. You do not have to import the components manually as the preloader will lazy load the components you use. Hence, if you for instance only use `<ino-button>`, the loader only requests the portions of the package which are needed to render the button.

There are two ways to add the inovex elements to your project. Either by loading them via a `script` tag from a central server or by downloading them via npm and adding them to your build process. It is your choice whether you want to use a package manager or the `script` tag.

There are some rules of thumb if you do not know which option better suits your project.

Use the `script` tag if...

- ... you just want to play around with our elements.
- ... you have a small website which does not use any library or framework.

Use the npm package manager if...

- ... you already started building a single page application.
- ... you plan to migrate a static website to a single page application.
- ... you plan to start a new project.

### Install via package manager

<StepIndicator step='1'>Add the package `@inovex.de/elements` to your project using **npm** or **yarn**:</StepIndicator>

<CH.Code>
  ```bash npm
  npm install @inovex.de/elements --save
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @inovex.de/elements
  ```
</CH.Code>
</MenuSection>

<MenuSection title='Integration via script tag'>

<StepIndicator step='2'>To load the components at runtime, you need to insert the following code fragment.
Make sure that the script tag is set on each web page the user can visit on your website.
For most of the websites it should be sufficient to add the tag to the `index.html` file (choose legacy for older browsers):</StepIndicator>
<CH.Code>
  ```html Modern
  <script
    type="module"
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inovex.de/elements@8.0.0/dist/inovex-elements/inovex-elements.esm.js"
  ></script>
  ```
  ```html Legacy
  <script
    nomodule=""
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inovex.de/elements@8.0.0/dist/inovex-elements/inovex-elements.js"
  ></script>
  ```
</CH.Code>

**Fetching the proper version:** Please note the version number (`8.0.0`) in the url above. This version might not be the latest version in future, so please update it with latest available version number on `elements.inovex.de` during your intial integration.


#### I do not want to pin to a concrete version, do you provide a link to the latest release?

Yes, we provide a link to our latest release, but we strongly recommend to not use these links in production since the application can easily break at any time. It is a best practice to pin to a version number to ensure that the application does not break unexpectedly.
However, for testing purposes, and if you just want to play around with the elements, you can always replace the version number with `latest`:

<CH.Code>
```html index.html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inovex.de/elements@latest/dist/inovex-elements/inovex-elements.esm.js"
></script>
```
</CH.Code>

<MenuSection title='Use the Components'>

You can now use the components on your website in the same way as you would use any native HTML element. To help you getting started, we created a [simple todo app](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ino-elements-js-example?embed=1&file=index.js) for you to play around with.
