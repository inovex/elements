        "title": "What are the inovex Elements?",
        "content": "The inovex Elements are a collection of components (e.g. buttons, text fields, ...) for the web, which are based on the Web Components standard. This allows us to use the inovex Elements in any web framework, creating a consistent UI/UX feeling across all applications while saving massive development and maintenance efforts."
      },
      {
        "title": "Why doesn't everyone use such a Web Components library?",
        "content": "Web components are a relatively new standard, which has only been supported by the most popular browsers since 2018. In addition, the maintenance of such a library is initially more complex, since each framework (React, Angular, ...) brings its own specifics with it. However, once this hurdle has been overcome, you can save yourself immense maintenance effort, since new components only have to be built once and can then be used in any framework."
