        "description": "In 2018 we started our journey. We spent weeks evaluating which framework matches our needs and which decision may last for the next few years. It’s always a bet on time in front-end worlds and never easy to make the right pick. We started the elements as a side project and evaluated which library and tools would be the best choice for helping us writing standards based Web Components. We tried a lot and looked into the available libraries Polymer, SkateJS, SlimJS, Switzerland and Stencil. We opposed the features and decided to use Stencil."

We understand what it means to create a library for a lot of people and being responsible for how to introduce breaking changes or how to handle bug fixes. It’s not easy, but it’s great to see the value we add to all the different projects."
