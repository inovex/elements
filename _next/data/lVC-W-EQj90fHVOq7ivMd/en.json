This allows us to use the inovex Elements in any web framework, creating a consistent UI/UX feeling across all applications while saving massive development and maintenance efforts."},{"title":"Why doesn't everyone use such a Web Components library?","content":"Web components are a relatively new standard, which has only been supported by the most popular browsers since 2018. In addition, the maintenance of such a library is initially more complex, since each framework (React, Angular, ...) brings its own specifics with it. However, once this hurdle has been overcome, you can save yourself immense maintenance effort, since new components only have to be built once and can then be used in any framework."},{"title":"Are the inovex Elements open source?","content":"Yes! The inovex Elements library is open source and made available for free under the MIT license."},{"title":"How can I use the Elements?","content":"You can use the inovex Elements web components library in any web project because they are based on web components, a framework independent standard. To make things even easier, we provide different packages for the commonly used frameworks like Angular, React and Vue. Have a look at our integration guides to see how to use them in detail."},{"title":"What requirements do the inovex Elements have?","content":"There are no requirements except that your application must be a web application.
