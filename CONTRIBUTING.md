# Contributing

Hello. nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project to make it even better. This guide will
help you understand the repository structure and the component architecture. In addition,
we have written down all the important information how we work, where we communicate and what rules
we follow to work as a team.

You can find that information in our [Storybook Contribution Guide](https://elements.inovex.de/dist/latest/storybook/?path=/story/docs-contributing--architectural-overview).
