This allows us to use the inovex Elements in any web framework, creating a consistent UI/UX feeling across all applications while saving massive development and maintenance efforts."},{"title":"Why doesn't everyone use such a Web Components library?","content":"Web components are a relatively new standard, which has only been supported by the most popular browsers since 2018. In addition, the maintenance of such a library is initially more complex, since each framework (React, Angular, ...) brings its own specifics with it. However, once this hurdle has been overcome, you can save yourself immense maintenance effort, since new components only have to be built once and can then be used in any framework."},{"title":"Are the inovex Elements open source?","content":"Yes! The inovex Elements library is open source and made available for free under the MIT license."},{"title":"How can I use the Elements?","content":"You can use the inovex Elements web components library in any web project because they are based on web components, a framework independent standard. To make things even easier, we provide different packages for the commonly used frameworks like Angular, React and Vue. Have a look at our integration guides to see how to use them in detail."},{"title":"What requirements do the inovex Elements have?","content":"There are no requirements except that your application must be a web application.

With the inovex Elements, we want to offer a library of web components to enable developers to create great user experiences quickly and time-efficiently."},{"title":"How do I report a Problem with the web-components?","content":"You can report a problem with the web-components by writing using our contact form or by opening an issue in our GitHub repository. Please provide as much information as possible (e.g. affected web-component, browser version and steps to reproduce the issue), so that we can investigate and solve any issue quickly."},{"title":"Why are the material web components used in the inovex Elements?","content":"To avoid reinventing the wheel, we built on top of Google‚Äôs Material Web Components, a comprehensive toolbox of the most common UI elements. This allows us to concentrate on our styling and special features without having to implement functionality that is already well-known and battle-tested."},{"title":"How often are the inovex Elements updated?","content":"We update the inovex Elements library regularly to ensure that our users are able to get the most out of our components.
